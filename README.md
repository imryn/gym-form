# My Gym-form

This web was developed through PHP course I took in school. You can see how I developed a form in PHP and HTML. The goal was to gather information about exercises and their training habits to create a suitable training recommendation for them. AT the main page you should fill the form in order to get recommendation. After you fill the form, you can see pie charts showing responses of all respondents. Used Google Charts API.
